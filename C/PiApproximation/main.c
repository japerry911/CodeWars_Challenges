/*
---Pi Approximation---
The aim of the kata is to try to show how difficult it can be to calculate decimals of an irrational number with a
certain precision. We have chosen to get a few decimals of the number "pi" using the following infinite series
(Leibniz 1646â€“1716):

PI / 4 = 1 - 1/3 + 1/5 - 1/7 + ... which gives an approximation of PI / 4.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leibniz_formula_for_%CF%80

To have a measure of the difficulty we will count how many iterations are needed to calculate PI with a given precision.

There are several ways to determine the precision of the calculus but to keep things easy we will calculate to
within epsilon of your language Math::PI constant. In other words we will stop the iterative process when the absolute
value of the difference between our calculation and the Math::PI constant of the given language is less than epsilon.

Your function returns an array or an arrayList or a string or a tuple depending on the language (See sample tests)
where your approximation of PI has 10 decimals

In Haskell you can use the function "trunc10Dble" (see "Your solution"); in Clojure you can use the function "round"
(see "Your solution");in OCaml or Rust the function "rnd10" (see "Your solution") in order to avoid discussions about
the result.

Example :

your function calculates 1000 iterations and 3.140592653839794 but returns:
iter_pi(0.001) --> [1000, 3.1405926538]
Unfortunately, this series converges too slowly to be useful, as it takes over 300 terms to obtain a 2 decimal place
precision. To obtain 100 decimal places of PI, it was calculated that one would need to use at least 10^50 terms of
this expansion!
